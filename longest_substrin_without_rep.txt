THE ALGORITHM

METHOD 1: Traditional Approach
Consider all substring and check whether it contains all unique characters or
not using another function 

METHOD 2: Window Sliding
Creating 2 pointers i, j
Creating a visited(string) from 0 to 256 
As j slides, will update visited when a character exist to 1
ex: arr[j] = C -> visited[int(arr[j])] = 1
when j meets an exits character, update visited[j] back to 0, j-1
record length (j-i+1), i = temp (local starting index will change when meet a
large length)
then continue
